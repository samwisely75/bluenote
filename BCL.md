# Bluenote Composition Language (BCL)

Bluenote Composition Language (BCL) is an IMAGINARY, domain-specific language designed for querying and manipulating data within the blueline. The language syntax is a blend of HTTP, JSON Query Language (JQL), XML Query Language (XQL), Cascade Style Sheet (CSS) Selector, Regular Expression (Regex), and SQL. It is designed for real hard-core black-and-white console jankies who want to play with waves of text data in the terminal like Matrix operators in the 21st century.

## Example

```
GET /_cat/shards

| WHERE .age > 30 AND .employ_status == "active"

```

```

        - match:
            title: "Blueline"
        - range:
            @timestamp:
              gte: "2023-01-01"
              lte: "${now/d}"
  size: 10
